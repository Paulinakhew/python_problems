| Byte Academy is a leading coding bootcamp that I attended for two months in New York. I completed the eight week full-time "Python Fullstack Immersive" program over the summer prior to starting university. This repository contains the problems that I was given as assignments. | This website has all of the assignments and course notes for CS2120. I am working on these assignments for fun and for practice! :nerd_face: |
